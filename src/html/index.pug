    p
      | One of the biggest complaints about RGB is the software ecosystem surrounding it. Every manufacturer has
      | their own app, their own brand, their own style. If you want to mix and match devices, you end up with a
      | ton of conflicting, functionally identical apps competing for your background resources. On top of that,
      | these apps are proprietary and Windows-only. Some even require online accounts. What if there was a way
      | to control all of your RGB devices from a single app, on both Windows and Linux, without any nonsense?
      | That is what OpenRGB sets out to achieve. One app to rule them all.

              | OpenRGB keeps it simple with a lightweight user interface that doesn&apos;t waste background
              | resources with excessive custom ../../static/images and styles. It is light on both RAM
              | and CPU usage, so your system can continue to shine without cutting into your gaming or
              | productivity performance.

            p
              | If you have RGB devices from many different manufacturers, you will likely have many
              | different programs installed to control all of your devices. These programs do not sync
              | with each other, and they all compete for your system resources. OpenRGB aims to replace
              | every single piece of proprietary RGB software with one lightweight app.
