"","","USB","HyperX Quadcast S","","","","","✔️","✔️","❌","The HyperX Quadcast S has a manufacturer issue
with the interface it uses (0) for controlling its RGB.
HID requires that any HID interface have at least one
Interrupt IN endpoint; however, the HXQS does not,
even though its interface reports itelf as hid and
responds to hid requests. As such Linux doesn't bind
to the usbhid driver and it goes undetected by
hidapi-hidraw. Windows does detect it as hid and hidapi
finds and interacts with it just fine. To work around
the Linux issue, hidapi-libusb is loaded dynamically
using dlopen/dlsym as hidapi using a libusb backend is
able to find the device and interact with it. This
requires that you have support for dlopen/dlsym on your
Linux platform as well as hidapi-libusb (and libusb)
libraries installed in the standard dynamic library
path.

The controller for this device has a wrapper for hidapi
functions so that the controller can be the same across
all platforms, but call the correct underlying functions
that are defined in the detector under an #ifdef
for that platform.

Additionally, hidapi-libusb has an error that causes
hid_close() to hang on this device, see:
https://github.com/libusb/hidapi/issues/456
This will be fixed on newer versions of hidapi-libusb,
but until then, OpenRGB will hang/crash if you try to
rescan devices once a HXQS has been detected during
program session."

Hardware modes are not implented
PLEASE UPDATE YOUR BIOS IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH HARDWARE MODES AFTER CLOSING OPENRGB

If you have other models beside the Legion 7 gen 6 and want to test if RGB can be added to OpenRGB,
you can do so if you're on Windows by running
[this Powershell script](https://gitlab.com/pvazny/legion7-rgb-ps) with the `-test` parameter:

```powershell
legion7-rgb.ps1 -test -v 0x048D -p 0xC935 -up 0xFF89 -u 0x07 -c 0xa1 -start 0x15 -stop 0xa1
```

This script will iterate through each LED one by one, in bank `$c = 0xa1`, between IDs
`-start 0x15` and `-stop 0xa1`, on the HID device with VID `-v 0x048D` PID `-p 0xC935` usage page
`-up 0xFF89` and usage `-u 0x07`. It will default to the Legion 7 Gen 6 description, however you can
enter a new description for each LED and at the end it will generate the differences.

To check if you have an eligible HID device that could potentially be iterated by the script please
open the powershell command prompt and executre the follow:

```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -Class 'HIDClass' | ForEach-Object { [PSCustomObject]@{Name = $_.FriendlyName; InstanceId = $_.InstanceId; HardwareId = ($_.HardwareId | Where-Object {$_ -like 'HID_DEVICE_UP:*' })}} | Where-Object { $_.HardwareId -ne $null } | Sort-Object InstanceId
```

If the script is successful please create a [new device issue](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/issues/new?issuable_template=New%20Device#)
and attach the relevant details to request support for your device."
